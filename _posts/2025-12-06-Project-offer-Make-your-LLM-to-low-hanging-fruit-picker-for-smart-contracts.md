### Project Introduction

LLMs are already proved that it has a strong potential to find 0days from any platforms.

A few weeks ago, I tried to give it a shot to finding vulnerabilities from some unfamiliar research target to me, Web3( blockchain, DeFi or whatever... ).

I only solved [Damn Vulnerable DeFi](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/) wargame before and have 0 experience about auditing real-world smart contracts code or blockchain node implementation.

I used **Claude Code** + **Sonnet 4.5** model and I found my first **high** severity vulnerability in smart contracts!

To be honest, I couldn't found any fun when I was auditing smart contracts code manually even though it is very expensive target compared to traditional old research targets like browser, kernel, mobile, etc... So I don't want to digging into the web3 bug bounty too deeply, just want to picking some low-hanging fruits by automating the process with LLM. Maybe we can finding some funs by tuning the LLM to web3 bug hunting automata with worthy profit.

I think there are some other competitors(?) are already trying to use LLM in same way but web3 bug bounty world is huge and I think it is not niche area as much as traditional major research targets.
